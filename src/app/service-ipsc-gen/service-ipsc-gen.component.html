            <p>Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine. They represent a single source of cells that could be used to replace those lost to damage or disease because they can propagate indefinitely, and give rise to every other cell type in the body (such as neurons, heart, pancreatic, and liver cells). </p>
            <p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (also known as iPS cells or iPSCs) are a type of pluripotent stem cells that can be derived directly from somatic cells. iPSCs are genetically reprogrammed from adult cells, and are similar to natural pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). While these artificially generated cells are not known to exist in the human body, their characteristics are remarkably similar to those of embryonic stem cells, such as the expression of certain stem cell genes and proteins, chromatin methylation patterns, doubling time, teratoma formation, and potency and differentiability. Since iPSCs can be derived directly from adult tissues, they not only bypass the need for embryos, but can be made in a patient-matched manner, which means that each individual could have their own pluripotent stem cell line. These unlimited supplies of autologous cells could be used to generate transplants without the risk of immune rejection. Therefore, iPSCs are an invaluable resource for drug discovery, cell therapy, and basic research. iPSCs have being used in personalized drug discovery efforts and understanding the patient-specific basis of disease. </p>
            <p>The iPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka, who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four transcription factors (named Oct3/4, Sox2, Myc, and Klf4) could convert adult cells into pluripotent state. Human iPSCs were first generated in 2007 through retrovirus- or lentivirus-mediated gene transduction. However, both viral vectors require integration into host chromosomes to express reprogramming genes. Genomic integration of transcription factors increases the risk of tumor formation and mortality in chimeric and progeny mice derived from iPSCs. Several methods have been developed to generate integration-free human iPSCs, including adenovirus, Sendai virus, the piggyBac system, minicircle vector, episomal vectors, direct protein delivery and synthesized mRNA. The reprogramming efficiency of these integration-free methods is impractically low in most cases. Direct delivery of proteins or RNA is labor-intensive, requiring repeated delivery of the reprogramming factors. Modifying Sendai virus vectors or preparing synthesized mRNAs are technically demanding. </p>

            <p class="pb-3">Upon receiving the source cells from customers, these cells will be expanded, transfected with episomal reprogramming vectors and plated on MEF feeders or under feeder-free conditions. The ESC-like clones were picked and characterized for pluripotency. The qualified clones were expanded and cryopreserved.</p>
            <h4 class="pb-3">Case studies</h4>
            <h5>Generation of human iPSCs from fibroblasts on feeder-free conditions</h5>
            <p>Here we demonstrate that ALSTEM’s episomal reprogramming kit (RF202) is able to efficiently generate human iPS cells from fibroblasts on feeder free conditions. About half million fibroblasts were transfected with episomal vectors using electroporation, the transfected cells were replated on vitronectin coated plate next day. The culture medium was changed to ReproTeSR medium on Day 2. On Day 4, some cell clusters with round shape appeared, and gradually became more like ES cells in morphology. On Day 15, change medium to E8 medium and continue to culture one week. After 3 – 4 weeks, some clones showed typical morphology of regular ESC colonies with large nuclei and indistinguishable cell boundary. These clones were picked and expanded for further characterization.</p>
